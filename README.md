                                  Hazard Prediction Model (HPM)
      
      1) What is it?
      
      HPM is a software capable of predicting the atmospheric dispersion of chemical warfare 
      agents resulting from terrorist events in Sri Lanka. The user has to provide information 
      related to release scenario and meteorological data as input and the program simulates 
      the dispersion and visualizes the ground level dosages on a satellite map (see the user 
      manual and demo: https://youtu.be/N6TukoAqg4g for more information). 
      Plesae refer to authors's MSc thesis for methodological details:  
      https://github.com/Madu86/HPM/blob/master/Thesis_Final.pdf
      
      The program was written in visual C# by Madushanka Manathunga as his MSc thesis project 
      during 2011-2012 under the guidance of Prof. M.S. Weerasinghe at the Department of Chemistry,
      University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
      
      2) Installation
      
      The current version (1.0.0) only runs on windows platform. We have tested it on windows xp 
      and windows 7 versions. 
      To install the program, simply run setup.exe and follow the instructions. 
      
      3) Distribution
