                                          Hazard Prediction Model (HPM)
      
      1) What is it?
      
      HPM is a software capable of predicting the atmospheric dispersion of chemical warfare agents resulting
      from terrorist events. The user has to provide information related to release scenario and meteorological
      data as input and the program simulates the dispersion and visualizes the ground level dosages on a 
      satellite map (see user manual and demo for more information). Plesae refer to Madushanka's MSc thesis 
      for methodological details.
      
      The program was written in visual C# by Madushanka Manathunga as his MSc thesis project during 2011-2012 under the 
      guidance of Prof. M.S. Weerasinghe at the Department of Chemistry, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
      
      2) Installation
      
      The current version only runs under windows platform. We have tested it on windows xp and windows 7 versions.
      To install the program, simply run setup.exe and follow the instructions. 
      
      3) Distribution
      
      Feel free to use the program or adopt parts of the code. However, please cite the work as follows.
